# Flask JWT Authentication Example

## This repository provides a simple example of implementing JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication in a Flask application. The following instructions will guide you through the installation, upgrading, and usage of Flask JWT.

# Installation

Install Flask JWT

pip3 install Flask-JWT

# Upgrade Flask JWT

If you already have Flask JWT installed and want to upgrade it, use the following command:

pip3 install --upgrade Flask-JWT

# Obtaining a JWT Token

To obtain a JWT token, make a POST request to the authentication endpoint of your Flask app using the curl command. Replace http://localhost:5000/auth with the appropriate URL of your authentication endpoint.

curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"username": "user1", "password": "password1"}' http://localhost:5000/auth

This will return a JWT token in the response.

# Accessing a Protected Route

To access a protected route with the obtained JWT token, make a GET request to the protected route using the curl command. Replace the JWT token and http://localhost:5000/protected with your actual token and protected route URL.

curl -X GET -H "Authorization: JWT <your-token-here>" http://localhost:5000/protected

Replace <your-token-here> with the JWT token obtained in the previous step.

Make sure to integrate these commands into your Flask application according to your specific authentication setup. This example assumes a basic setup, and additional configuration may be required based on your application's needs.
